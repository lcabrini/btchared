The Bard's Cheat: a character Editor for the Bard's Tale and the Bard's Tale II

A long, long time ago, I wrote a character editor for the Bard's Tale, since my character disk kept getting corrupted. Eventually, my source disks also got corrupted and I moved on to other things.

Since I still play Bard's Tale from time to time and since I'm looking for little projects to help me get back into retro-coding, I thought I might as well try to rewrite my character editor.
